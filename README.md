# PlaystationHaven
This website is a mock-up for a Playstation repair service, inspired by my passion and interest in ps3 technology since I was young. 
 
 The purpose of this website is to demonstrate my skills and understanding of vanilla HTML and CSS. The site is responsive, features three pages and makes use of flexbox, grid, CSS variables, media queries etc.
